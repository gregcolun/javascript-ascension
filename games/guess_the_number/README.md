# Number Guesser

**Number Guesser** is a simple JavaScript game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   node script.js

The game will welcome you and prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess and follow the on-screen instructions to continue guessing.
Once you've guessed the correct number, the game will display the number of guesses you took.
You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'Y' to play another round or 'N' to exit the game.


## Game Logic
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated at the beginning of each round.
You will be prompted to guess the number.
Invalid inputs (non-numeric inputs, numbers outside the valid range) will be rejected.
You will receive hints whether your guess is higher or lower than the target number.
The game continues until you guess the correct number.
After guessing correctly, you will be shown the target number and the number of guesses you took.
